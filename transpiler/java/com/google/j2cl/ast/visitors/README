Contained here are J2CL AST visitors.

They should be for normalization and structural/interdependent AST changes and
not for simple data gathering (simple data gathering should be generator
package visitors that are run as part of template context construction).

As a rule of thumb (when modifying AST) don't copy information, always
reference. For example don't synthesize Import nodes from TypeReference data
because doing so creates the opportunity for data desynchronization if
TypeReference content is updated.
