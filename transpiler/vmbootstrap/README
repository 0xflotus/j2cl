VMBootstrap is the collection of native JS logic that needs to be
available to transpiled output but that is not part of the JRE but
references to the JRE.

For example the implementation of the Java "assert" keyword is not
JRE logic so it is implemented in a separate location, but it does
throw the JRE's AssertionError class and so must have access to
the JRE's classes.

So, conceptually it is the third layer of JS because it depends
upon JRE, which is the second layer.

Build integration that synthesizes js_library rules from java_library
rules should synthesize a dependency on VMBootstrap so that an
implementation is available for the VMBootstrap functions that are
called in the transpiled JS.
