NativeBootstrap is the collection of native JS logic that needs to be
available to transpiled output but that is not part of the JRE and does
not reference the JRE.

Conceptually it is the lowest layer of JS because it is depended upon
by others but depends on no one.

Build integration that synthesizes js_library rules from java_library
rules should synthesize a dependency on NativeBootstrap so that an
implementation is available for the NativeBootstrap functions that are
called in the transpiled JS.
